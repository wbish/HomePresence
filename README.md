# HomePresence
Automated Simulated Presence Sensor for SmartThings

HomePresence sets a 'Simulated Presence Sensor' device to away when everyone is away and sets the presence to present when anyone is present.

Why? Because IFTTT does not support multiple selections for presence sensors. I want to be able to trigger an action when both my wife and I have left the house, as opposed to when only one of us leaves and the other is still home.
